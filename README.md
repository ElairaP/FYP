# Final Year Project
# Artificial Neural Networks for Breast Cancer Diagnsis: An Exploration of Performance and Explainability
## About the Project
- This project involved using Machine Learning (ML) to predict breast cancer diagnoses as well as using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to help explain the reasoning behind the ML model's prediction.

- The project had two main aims:
  - To investigate the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
    - This was achieved by using performance metrics to evaluate the ANN and comparing its performance to other Machine Learning (ML) models.
  - To make an ANN model more explainable.
    - This was acheived by using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to improve the understanding of relarionships between features and predictions.

- Completed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook
  - Python packages: Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP, DiCE.

 ## Dataset
-  Project uses the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset from the UCI machine learning repository.

## Machine Learning
- ML models investigated: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regressions (LR)

## XAI
